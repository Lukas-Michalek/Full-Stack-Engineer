So instead of using h1 and going in with CSS and customizing or kind of overriding the default CSS that comes with each h1 tags, what I am doing with SPAN is saying, all right I don`t want any of that default styling, just let me start with like the standard stylling that SPAN tag comes with which is very minimal compared to the H1 tags or H2-->
